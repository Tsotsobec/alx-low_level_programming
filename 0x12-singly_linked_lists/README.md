#ALX Project: 0x12. C - Singly linked lists

For this project, we are expected to look at the concept of Data Structures and be able to understand the following:

a)When and why using linked lists vs arrays
b)How to build and use linked lists

#Project Tasks:

0.Print list:
Create a function that prints all the elements of a list-t list.

1.List length:
Create a function that returns the number of elements in a linked list-t list.

2.Add node:
Create a function that adds a new node at the beginning of a list-t list.

3.Add node at the end:
Create a function that adds a new node at the end of a list-t list.

4.Free list:
Create a function that frees a list-t list.

5.The Hare and the Tortoise:
Create a function that prints You're beat! and yet, you must allow,\nI bore my house upon my back!\n before the main function is executed.

6.Real programmers can write assembly code in any language:
Create a 64-bit program in assembly that prints Hello, Holberton, followed by a new line.

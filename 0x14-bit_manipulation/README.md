#ALX Project: 0x14. C - Bit manipulation ( Low level programming in C )

Learning Objective: How to manipulate bits and use bitwise operators

#Project Tasks:

0.0:
Create a function that converts a binary number to an unsigned int and Returns the converted number or 0.

1.1:
Create a function that prints the binary representation of a number (arrays, malloc, % or / operators are prohibited).

2.10:
Create a function that returns the value of a bit at a given index.

3.11:
Craete a function that sets the value of a bit to 1 at a given index and Returns 1 if it successful or -1 if an error occurs.

4.100:
Craete a function that sets the value of a bit to 0 at a given index and Returns 1 if it successful or -1 if an error occurs.

5.101:
Create a function that returns the number of bits you would need to flip to get from one number to another (% or / operators are prohibited).

6.Endianness:
Create a function that checks the endianness and Returns 0 if big endian or 1 if little endian.

7.Crackme3:
Find the password for this program:
